I actively recruit every year for motivated, ambitious, and passionate graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and undergraduate researchers to join the lab.

I am part of the ECE, CS, BME and Physics Graduate Groups. If you are part of Cornell University from any department and want to work on Medical Image Analysis, reach out to me.

If you are interested in a Post-Doc position, please email me your CV along with a brief description of your background and career goals. Applicants should have a strong publication record, including at least three first-author publications in top-tier journals or conferences related to medical imaging and machine learning. Prior experience in these fields is strongly preferred. I am happy to tell you about any opportunities we might have for you. We are trying to build a strong, inclusive and supportive research community in AI for medical imaging at Cornell.
